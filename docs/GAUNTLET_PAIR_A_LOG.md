# Gauntlet ledger — Phase 3 **Pair A** (UI): death screen + stat legibility

Roadmap step 4, Pair A of `docs/GAME_FEEDBACK_PLAN.md` — the (i)
death/completion screen plus the stat-legibility promotion
(decision #40b).  Run as a LOOPED AUTONOMOUS session under the
one-step-per-gauntlet process ruled in decision #41c.

- **Branch**: `claude/gauntlet-pair-a-772nqe`, off the tip of
  `claude/game-feedback-plan-UN3MV` (`b4b9a28`).
- **Target PR**: into `claude/game-feedback-plan-UN3MV`, not merged.
- **Scope fence**: no SFX (Pair B), no controller (Pair C), no polish
  batch, no economy or boss changes.
- **Hard constraint (A1)**: death SEMANTICS do not change.
  `respawnPlayer()` still refills at the current map's spawn and the run
  continues.  The death penalty / return-to-hub question is owned by the
  economy tuning pass (roadmap step 6, decisions #40a/#42d).  The screen
  is PRESENTATION around existing behaviour.

## Milestone checklist

- [ ] **A1** — Death/run-summary screen (overlay + per-run counters +
      RESPAWN / RESTART RUN / MAIN MENU actions)
- [ ] **A2** — Stat legibility: per-module attribution on
      `EngineStats.outfitting`, full derived-stat set in the pause Ship
      Status, hex→stat highlighting
- [ ] **A3** — Validation + presentation pass (phone-scale DOM
      measurement, full-loop smoke, CLAUDE.md final sync)

## Per-iteration log

### Iteration 0 — grounding + ledger

Read the plan-doc roadmap step 4, the Phase 3 Pair A table, decisions
#40b (stat legibility promoted into Pair A) / #41c (one roadmap step per
gauntlet, own branch + PR into the plan branch), and the parking-lot
entry "Pause-menu stat legibility — per-module effect attribution" (the
A2 spec sketch).  Confirmed the branch is at the plan tip.  `npm install`
+ `npm run build` green at baseline (the container had no `node_modules`).
Playwright + Chromium confirmed present at
`/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright` / `/opt/pw-browsers`, so the
boss gauntlet's headless-smoke approach carries over.

Surveyed the code the two milestones touch:

- **Death today**: `updatePhysics` routes `player.health <= 0` into
  `handleEntityDeath` → `startExplosion`; when `explosionTimer` runs out
  the loop calls `respawnPlayer()` directly.  There is no death state and
  no UI beat — the run just continues.
- **Sim-freeze precedent**: the `dockedAtStation` short-circuit in
  `loop()` (push stats → `draw()` → `return`) is the pattern A1 copies.
- **Run-scoped reset**: `resetAndLoadSelectedMap()` is where new per-run
  counters must be zeroed (it is deliberately the half `transitionToMap`
  skips, so counters survive a portal — which is correct for a run
  summary).
- **Existing engine paths for the actions**: `startGame()` (→ PLAYING +
  `initWaveSystem` + `seedAmbientBubbles`) and `restartGame()`
  (`resetAndLoadSelectedMap()` → MENU).  Both already wired through
  `App.tsx` (`handleStart` / `handleRestart`).
- **A2 surfaces**: `applyModuleEffects` (sums ACTIVE module effects),
  `outfittingSnapshot()` (builds `EngineStats.outfitting`), and the
  shared hex renderers at `UIOverlay` component scope
  (`renderHexGroup` / `renderInventoryHex` / `renderModuleDetail`).

## Decisions taken

_(Each entry: what was chosen, the alternatives, and why.)_

- **D0 — ledger created before any code.** Alternative: log at the end
  of each milestone only.  Chosen because the loop re-grounds from this
  file every iteration, so it has to exist from iteration 0.
